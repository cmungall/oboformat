Instructions:

We will work through the examples in this directory. Each section
introduces new constructs and/or concepts.

For each section, the instructor will first demonstrate some
examples. The students will then follow the instructions in the
README.txt file for the section. After completion, the students can
exchange OWL files and review one another's work.
