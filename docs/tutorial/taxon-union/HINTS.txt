The ontology contains the axiom

 "Nematoda or Protostomia" EquivalentTo Nematoda or Protostomia

Which is to say that the set of things called "nematoda or
protostomia" is identical to the combination of the set of nematodes
and the set of protostomes.

Since every member of that combined set is necessarily a bilaterian,
then the class "Nematoda or Protostomia" is a subclass of Bilateria.

When creating your own classes:

# add a class under "Thing"
# name it
# Click + on "Equivalence Axioms"
# type an expression. remembering single quotes around classes that have spaces. Example:
  'Drosophila melanogaster' or Fungi

Hints for excluding taxa:

Use the keyword "not" to exclude a class. E.g. "(a or b) and (not z) and (not y)"
