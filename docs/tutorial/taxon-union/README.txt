This example extends the previous one introducing "or" (UnionOf) and "not" (complementOf)

Instructions:

# open taxslim-with-union.owl
# briefly check the asserted hierarchy if you like - this is a subset of the NCBI taxonomy
# Examine the "union" classes at the top of the class hierarchy. In particular:
 # 'Nematoda or Protostomia' (note that ncbi classifies nematodes as pseudocoelomata)
 # 'Bacteria or Viridiplantae'
# Select hermit as the reasoner and start it
# where have the union terms gone? Check their placement in the class hierarchy. In particular the two classes above

# Create your own grouping classes and classify them. Some examples:
 # mouse or human
 # mouse or primate
 # Pescetarian dietary component (plant or fish)
 # Pescetarian dietary component, more relaxed variant (plant or fish or fungi or mollusc or arthropod)
# Note: don't manually place these in the hierarchy, let the reasoner do this
# Tip: use the DL query tab to test your class expression first

# Create a non-sensical "transgenic hybrid" class, such as a fly-human - which is both a Drosophila and a human. What happens to this when you classify?
# try using the explanations feature (the "?").
 # Hint: the explanation is more compact if you choose two sibling taxa - e.g. Deuterostome and Protostome
# Remove the hybrid class before moving . 

# Use the DL query tab to find all mammals that are not humans
# Try creating one or more of the following paraphyletic classes. This will involve the "not" construct
 # Nonhuman primate
 # Invertebrate
 # Invertebrate chordate
 # Reptilia, as traditionally defined: (amniote minus aves and mammals)
 # Land mammal
# What happens when you classify?
# see HINTS.txt if you get stuck
