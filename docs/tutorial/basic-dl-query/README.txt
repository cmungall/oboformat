# open cc.owl
# Turn on hermit
# go to DL query tab
# find all subtypes of chromosome
# experiment with the tab - what do the different checkboxes give you?
# find all parts of the nucleus
# find all chromosomes that are part of the nucleus

NEXT:

# find all classes whose instances have a snRNP as part
# find all classes whose instances have a U11 snRNP and U12 snRNP as parts
# find all classes whose instances have a U11 snRNP or U12 snRNP as parts
