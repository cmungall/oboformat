  Constructs: owl:imports

# open response.owl
## this should open immediately. If you are prompted with a question asking the location of stimulus.owl, use the version in this directory
# view the import chain
# examine the "response to stimulus" and "detection of stimulus" hierarchy
# start the reasoner and examine the inferred hierarchy
# find an asserted classification where the response class is not defined
## choose 'response to fatty acid' if you're stuck here
# remove the asserted classification(s)
# add a class in the stimulus ontology in the appropriate place
# add a class definition (Equivalent class expression)
# synchronize the reasoner
# save your work
# kill the window/session and re-open, check what you have is there
# check you added the stimulus class to the stimulus ontology
