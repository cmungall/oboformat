def: "The chemical reactions and pathways involving organic or inorganic compounds that contain nitrogen, including (but not limited to) nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, assimilatory/dissimilatory nitrate reduction and the interconversion of nitrogenous organic matter and ammonium." [CHEBI:51143, GOC:go_curators, GOC:jl, ISBN:0198506732]
comment: Note that amino acid and derivative metabolism should not be annotated here. Instead use the 'amino acid and derivative metabolism' node.

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

def: "The chemical reactions and pathways, including anabolism and catabolism, by which living organisms transform chemical substances. Metabolic processes typically transform small molecules, but also include macromolecular processes such as DNA repair and replication, and protein synthesis and degradation." [GOC:go_curators, ISBN:0198547684]
comment: Note that metabolic processes do not include single functions or processes such as protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acids, nor receptor-ligand interactions.
