Pre-req: Intro to multiple ontologies

Inputs:

* cocaine-metabolism.owl

This ontology imports bio-chebi.owl

Goal:

# Create logical definitions (equivalence axioms) for the 3 cocaine metabolism related classes.
# Set reasoner to Elk and classify
# Check the results

Are they classified correctly? Can you explain why?

Bonus:

Explanations are broken using Elk. Try using another reasoner and getting explanations for the classifications
