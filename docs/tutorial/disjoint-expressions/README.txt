This example extends the previous disjoint classes example to include class expressions

(advanced)

Constructs illustrates:

 * Disjoint class expressions

Instructions:

# open bad-chromosome-2.owl
## Hint: this is the same as the previous example, except we have removed the "nuclear part" and "mitochondrial part" terms
# Do a query for all parts of a nucleus - how many?
# Do a query for all parts of a mitochondrion - how many?
# can you tell what the problem with chromosome is?
# add a disjointness axiom
## Hint: You need to go to active ontology/general axioms
# Select HermiT and start it up
# Find the problem and get an explanation
