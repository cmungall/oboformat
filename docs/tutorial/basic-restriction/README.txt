This example illustrates basic existential restrictions combined with subclass.

Example: "every finger is part of some hand" is represented as
  finger SubClassOf part_of some hand

Instructions:

# open er-sec-complex.owl
# navigate to the class "protein complex" using the search box
# Add a class 'endoplasmic reticulum Sec complex' as a subclass of "protein complex"
# Say that every ER-Sec-complex is part of a rough ER membrane
# Say that it has a Sec61 translocon complex as part
# Save your ontology, we may come back to it later

Navigating over the resulting ontology:

# navigate to "rough ER membrane"
# Find the parts of the rough ER membrane
## At this point the course instructor will show some of the tools for navigating around non-subclass relationships
