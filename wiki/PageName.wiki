#summary Guide to parsing OBO-Format

= Introduction =

This document provides guidelines for parsing OBO-Format documents using the reference parser.

The org.oboformat codebase provides two key components:

  * A *parser*, which translates obo-format documents into obo *document* objects
  * A *translator*, which translates obo *document* objects into OWLOntology objects (depends on OWLAPI)

It is *strongly recommended* that software applications using this library performs both steps and consume OWLOntology objects. The following advantages are gained:

 * That application is then able to work with both obo *and* owl documents
 * The application is future-proofed in the case of the input ontology moving to OWL as it's primary format
 * The application can take of all the features of the OWL API, including integration with reasoners

Whilst it is true that this library can perform a reverse lossy translation from OWL to OBO-Format, use of the obo document objects in inherently limited, as these will never support all OWL constructs
